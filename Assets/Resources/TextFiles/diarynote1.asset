  Text: "April 5th\r\n\r\nToday was just one of those days. I woke up feeling exhausted
    and stressed, and it just got worse from there. \r\n\r\nThe project is not going
    well and I fear we are in over our heads.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, I'm doubting
    if I'm cut out for this and I keep second-guessing myself and feeling like I'm
    not good enough for the job.\r\n\r\nI hope tomorrow is a better day."
