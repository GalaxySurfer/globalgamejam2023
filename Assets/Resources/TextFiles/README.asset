  Text: "Hey there Nugget\n \nIf you're reading this, I'm dead.\n \nI know we haven't
    talked together in a while and I'm sorry about that. But I need you to help me
    with something now. It's a matter of utmost importance.\n \nI need you to erase
    some sensitive data from my system. It's critical that you completely wipe these
    files and that nobody ever sees the content of these files. They are private
    and I don't want anyone else in our family to see them. That also means you.
    Just delete them.\n \nAll the files you have to delete are .bin. \n \nGet Cutty
    to assist you.\n \n \nI'm sorry\n \n/Sarah"
